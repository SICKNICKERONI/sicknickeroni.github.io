# SICKNICKERONI

## My current project is a Clicker Game.
It's heavily inspired by Cookie Clicker. (Basically a rip and test of my javascript skills) And...  
WE JUST WENT INTO 1.0.0! Updates from now on may take longer as the project is kind of easy to customize if you fork and it's done in my eyes.  
You can play the game here: [Clicker Game](https://sicknickeroni.github.io/clicker-game/)  
You can play the test branch here: [Clicker Game Dev](https://sicknickeroni.github.io/clicker-game-dev/)  
You can see the repository here: [Clicker Game Repository](https://github.com/SICKNICKERONI/clicker-game/)
